    <h4>this is a filthy PBJ from snotbelly sandwiches shop</h4>

    <p>really yuou should make your own.  any time you buy one of these its total crap.  i promise you will not be disappointed.  you can make rthese fast.
        once i learn some more advanced codint, lemme tell you ill makw this stoy so long and boring, with multiple clicks to get to the recipe which is never any better than betty crocker.
        Also in this crap you can pick the jelly flavor that suits your taste best and also your choice of bread type.  I like whole wheat and shit.
